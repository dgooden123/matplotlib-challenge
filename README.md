Data analysis of Pymaceuticals Inc 249 mice study. Mice were identified with SCC tumor growth and were treated through a variety of drug regimens.
Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The jupyter notebook compares the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, 
versus the other treatment regimens. 
Output includes summary statistics and plots. 
1. Mice treated with Ketapril had the highest average tumor volume throughout the study suggesting it is the least effect treatment 
2. The Ketapril treatment group had the highest variance for tumor size throughout the study suggesting a wide spread of data
3. The number of mice treated by regimen were not equal, more mice were treated with Ramicane and Capomulin compared to the other drugs, suggesting there could be some bias
